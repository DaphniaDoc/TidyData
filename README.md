# TidyData
Here we download data sets, merge them, extract the requested measurements, add appropriate labels, create a new tidy data set and save it to a txt file. 
The data was uploaded and read into r studio. Then I checked the metadata using head() and View() then I needed to format the data (training and text). The data exists in 3 different files. I merged the files into the 3 files (subject, activity, features). Then I fixed the column names. I then used cbind to merge the three data sets into one and saved it as completeData. I then extracted all the columns with mean or standard deviation data in them and subset them. I added names from the activityLabels file, then I changed the column names to more appropriate names. I made "subject" in to a factor variable, then I extracted the average for each activity and subject, ordered it, then saved it to a .txt. file named tidy.txt
